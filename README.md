There is a database of 1000 Chinese characters written in cursive script style. Each character is stored as a separate XML file with the strokes and points information. The program reads in each character XML and analyses the flow vectors in a 5 x 5 grid. It keeps the data in two files: one is the charTrain.csv for subsequent use; another is a PNG image file showing all the flow grid cells aligned in the same order of the original Chinese 1000 characters classic text. 

Version 2 of the program will output each individual character a separate PNG file showing the original character and its flow analysis.

The program depends on

Processing 3.1.2
